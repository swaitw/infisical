## Probation period

We are fully committed to ensuring that you are set up for success, but also understand that it may take some time to determine whether or not there is a long term fit between you and Infisical.

The first 3 months of your employment with Infisical is a probation period. During this time, you can choose to end your contract with 1 week's notice. If we chose to end your contract, Infisical will pay you 4 weeks' pay, but usually ask you to finish on the same day.

People in sales roles, such as Account Executives, have a 6 month probation period - this is to account for the fact that it can be difficult to establish whether or not someone is able to close contracts within their first 3 months, given sales cycles.

Your manager is responsible for monitoring and specifically reviewing your performance throughout this initial period. If under-performance is a concern, or if there is any hesitation regarding the future at Infisical, this should be discussed immediately with you and your manager.


## Severance

At Infisical, average performance gets a generous severance.

If Infisical decides to end your contract after the first 3 months of employment have been completed, we will give you 10 weeks' pay. It is likely we will ask you to stop working immediately.

If the decision to leave is yours, then we just require 1 month of notice.

We have structured notice in this way as we believe it is in neither Infisical's nor your interest to lock you into a role that is no longer right for you due to financial considerations. This extended notice period only applies in the case of under-performance or a change in business needs - if your contract is terminated due to gross misconduct then you may be dismissed without notice. If this policy conflicts with the requirements of your local jurisdiction, then those local laws will take priority.
