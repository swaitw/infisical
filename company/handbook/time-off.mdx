We offer eveyone at Infisical unlimited time off. We care about your results, not how long you work.

To request time off, just submit a request in Rippling and let Maidul know at least a week in advance. 

## National holidays

Since Infisical's team is globally distributed, it is hard for us to keep track of all the various national holidays across many different countries. Whether you'd like to celebrate Christmas or National Brisket Day (which, by the way, is on May 28th), you are welcome to take PTO on those days – just let Maidul know at least a week ahead so that we can adjust our planning. 

## Winter break 

Every year, Infisical team goes on a company-wide vacation during winter holidays. This year, the winter break period starts on December 21st, 2024 and ends on January 5th, 2025. You should expect to do no scheduled work during this period, but we will have a rotation process for [high and urgent service disruptions](https://infisical.com/sla). 

## Parental leave

At Infisical, we recognize that parental leave is a special and important time, significantly different from a typical vacation. We’re proud to offer parental leave to everyone, regardless of gender, and whether you’ve become a parent through childbirth or adoption.

For team members who have been with Infisical for over a year by the time of your child’s birth or adoption, you are eligible for up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave. This leave will be provided in one continuous block to allow you uninterrupted time with your family. If you have been with Infisical for less than a year, we will follow the parental leave provisions required by your local jurisdiction.

While we trust your judgment, parental leave is intended to be a distinct benefit and is not designed to be combined with our unlimited PTO policy. To ensure fairness and balance, we generally discourage combining parental leave with an extended vacation.

When you’re ready, please notify Maidul about your plans for parental leave, ideally at least four months in advance. This allows us to support you fully and arrange any necessary logistics, including salary adjustments and statutory paperwork.

We’re here to support you as you embark on this exciting new chapter in your life!
