<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Usage">
    **Prerequisites:**

    - Set up and add envars to [Infisical Cloud](https://app.infisical.com).
    - Set up Azure and have an existing App Configuration instance.
    - User setting up the integration on Infisical must have the `App Configuration Data Owner` role for the intended Azure App Configuration instance.
    - Azure App Configuration instance must be reachable by Infisical.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Authorize Infisical for Azure App Configuration">
        Navigate to your project's integrations tab

        ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/new-infisical-integration.png)

        Press on the Azure App Configuration tile and grant Infisical access to App Configuration.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Start integration">
        Obtain the Azure App Configuration endpoint from the overview tab.
        ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/azure-app-config-endpoint.png)

        Select which Infisical environment secrets you want to sync to your Azure App Configuration. Then, input your App Configuration instance endpoint. Optionally, you can define a prefix for your secrets which will be appended to the keys upon syncing.

        ![integrations](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/create-integration-form.png)

        Press create integration to start syncing secrets to Azure App Configuration.

        <Note>
          The Azure App Configuration integration requires the following permissions to be set on the user / service principal
          for Infisical to sync secrets to Azure App Configuration: `Read Key-Value`, `Write Key-Value`, `Delete Key-Value`.

          Any role with these permissions would work such as the **App Configuration Data Owner** role. Alternatively, you can use the
          **App Configuration Data Reader** role for read-only access or **App Configuration Data Contributor** role for read/write access.
        </Note>

      </Step>
      <Step title="Additional Configuration">

        #### Azure references
          When adding secrets in Infisical that reference Azure Key Vault secrets, Infisical will automatically sets the content type to `application/vnd.microsoft.appconfig.keyvaultref+json;charset=utf-8` in Azure App Configuration. 
          The following reference formats are automatically detected when added on Infisical's side:
          - `{ "uri": "https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/my-secret" }`
          - `https://my-key-vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/my-secret`

        #### Azure Labels 
          You can sync secrets from Infisical to Azure with custom labels by enabling the `Use Labels` option during setup:

          **When enabled**: Secrets will be pushed to Azure with your specified label

          **When disabled**: Secrets will be pushed with an empty (null) label

        <Info>
          If you have set the initial sync to `import` have behavior, the label selection affects which secrets are imported from Azure:
          - With `Use Labels` disabled: Only secrets with empty labels are imported on initial sync
          - With `Use Labels` enabled: Only secrets matching your specified label are imported on initial sync
        </Info>
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Tab title="Self-Hosted Setup">
    Using the Azure App Configuration integration on a self-hosted instance of Infisical requires configuring an application in Azure
    and registering your instance with it.

    **Prerequisites:**

    - Set up Azure and have an existing App Configuration instance.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create an application in Azure">
        Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations to create a new application.

        <Info>
          Azure Active Directory is now Microsoft Entra ID.
        </Info>
        ![integrations Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-aad.png)
        ![integrations Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-new-app.png)

        Create the application. As part of the form, set the **Redirect URI** to `https://your-domain.com/integrations/azure-app-configuration/oauth2/callback`.
        <Tip>
          The domain you defined in the Redirect URI should be equivalent to the `SITE_URL` configured in your Infisical instance.
        </Tip>

        ![integrations Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/app-registration-redirect.png)

        After registration, set the API permissions of the app to include the following Azure App Configuration permissions: KeyValue.Delete, KeyValue.Read, and KeyValue.Write.
        ![integrations Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/app-api-permissions.png)

      </Step>
      <Step title="Add your application credentials to Infisical">
        Obtain the **Application (Client) ID** in Overview and generate a **Client Secret** in Certificate & secrets for your Azure application.

        ![integrations Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-1.png)
        ![integrations Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-2.png)
        ![integrations Azure app config](../../images/integrations/azure-app-configuration/config-credentials-3.png)

        Back in your Infisical instance, add two new environment variables for the credentials of your Azure application.

        - `CLIENT_ID_AZURE`: The **Application (Client) ID** of your Azure application.
        - `CLIENT_SECRET_AZURE`: The **Client Secret** of your Azure application.

        Once added, restart your Infisical instance and use the Azure App Configuration integration.
