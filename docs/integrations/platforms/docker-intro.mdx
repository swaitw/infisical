<Info>
The main difference between the "Docker Entrypoint" and "Docker run" approach is where the Infisical CLI is installed. 
In most production settings, it's typically less convenient to have the Infisical CLI installed and executed externally, so we suggest using the "Docker Entrypoint" method for production purposes. 
However, if this limitation doesn't apply to you, select the method that best fits your needs.
