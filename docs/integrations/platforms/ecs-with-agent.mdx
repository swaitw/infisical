This guide will go over the steps needed to access secrets stored in Infisical from Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

At a high level, the steps involve setting up an ECS task with an [Infisical Agent](/infisical-agent/overview) as a sidecar container. This sidecar container uses [AWS Auth](/documentation/platform/identities/aws-auth) to authenticate with Infisical to fetch secrets/access tokens.
Once the secrets/access tokens are retrieved, they are then stored in a shared [Amazon Elastic File System](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) (EFS) volume. This volume is then made accessible to your application and all of its replicas.

This guide primarily focuses on integrating Infisical Cloud with Amazon ECS on AWS Fargate and Amazon EFS.
However, the principles and steps can be adapted for use with any instance of Infisical (on premise or cloud) and different ECS launch configurations.

## Prerequisites

This guide requires the following prerequisites:

- Infisical account
- Git installed
- Terraform v1.0 or later installed
- Access to AWS credentials
- Understanding of [Infisical Agent](/infisical-agent/overview)

## What we will deploy

For this demonstration, we'll deploy the [File Browser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) application on our ECS cluster.
Although this guide focuses on File Browser, the principles outlined here can be applied to any application of your choice.

File Browser plays a key role in this context because it enables us to view all files attached to a specific volume.
This feature is important for our demonstration, as it allows us to verify whether the Infisical agent is depositing the expected files into the designated file volume and if those files are accessible to the application.

<Warning>
  Volumes that contain sensitive secrets should not be publicly accessible. The
  use of File Browser here is solely for demonstration and verification
  purposes.
</Warning>

## Configure Authentication with Infisical

In order for the Infisical agent to fetch credentials from Infisical, we'll first need to authenticate with Infisical. Follow the documentation to configure a machine identity with AWS Auth [here](/documentation/platform/identities/aws-auth).
Take note of the Machine Identity ID as you will be needing this in the preceding steps.

## Clone guide assets repository

To help you quickly deploy the example application, please clone the guide assets from this [Github repository](https://github.com/Infisical/infisical-guides.git).
This repository contains assets for all Infisical guides. The content for this guide can be found within a sub directory called `aws-ecs-with-agent`.
The guide will assume that `aws-ecs-with-agent` is your working directory going forward.

## Deploy example application

Before we can deploy our full application and its related infrastructure with Terraform, we'll need to first configure our Infisical agent.

### Agent configuration overview

The agent config file defines what authentication method will be used when connecting with Infisical along with where the fetched secrets/access tokens should be saved to.

Since the Infisical agent will be deployed as a sidecar, the agent configuration file will need to be encoded in base64.
This encoding step is necessary as it allows the agent configuration file to be added into our Terraform configuration without needing to upload it first.

#### Full agent configuration file

Inside the `aws-ecs-with-agent` directory, you will find a sample `agent-config.yaml` file. This agent config file will connect with Infisical Cloud using AWS Auth and deposit access tokens at path `/infisical-agent/access-token` and render secrets to file `/infisical-agent/secrets`.

```yaml agent-config.yaml
infisical:
  address: https://app.infisical.com
  exit-after-auth: true
auth:
  type: aws-iam
sinks:
  - type: file
    config:
      path: /infisical-agent/access-token
templates:
  - template-content: |
      {{- with secret "202f04d7-e4cb-43d4-a292-e893712d61fc" "dev" "/" }}
      {{- range . }}
      {{ .Key }}={{ .Value }}
      {{- end }}
      {{- end }}
    destination-path: /infisical-agent/secrets
```

#### Secret template

The Infisical agent accepts one or more optional templates. If provided, the agent will fetch secrets using the set authentication method and format the fetched secrets according to the given template.
Typically, these templates are passed in to the agent configuration file via file reference using the `source-path` property but for simplicity we define them inline.

In the agent configuration above, the template defined will transform the secrets from Infisical project with the ID `202f04d7-e4cb-43d4-a292-e893712d61fc`, in the `dev` environment, and secrets located in the path `/`, into a `KEY=VALUE` format.

<Tip>
  Remember to update the project id, environment slug and secret path to one
  that exists within your Infisical project
</Tip>

## Configure app on terraform

Navigate to the `ecs.tf` file in your preferred code editor. In the container_definitions section, assign the values to the `machine_identity_id` and `agent_config` properties.
The `agent_config` property expects the base64-encoded agent configuration file. In order to get this, we use the `base64encode` and `file` functions of HCL.

```hcl ecs.tf
...snip...
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "app" {
  family                   = "cb-app-task"
  execution_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_execution_role.arn
  task_role_arn            = aws_iam_role.ecs_task_role.arn
  network_mode             = "awsvpc"
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]
  cpu                      = 4096
  memory                   = 8192
  container_definitions = templatefile("./templates/ecs/cb_app.json.tpl", {
    app_image           = var.app_image
    sidecar_image       = var.sidecar_image
    app_port            = var.app_port
    fargate_cpu         = var.fargate_cpu
    fargate_memory      = var.fargate_memory
    aws_region          = var.aws_region
    machine_identity_id = "5655f4f5-332b-45f9-af06-8f493edff36f"
    agent_config = base64encode(file("../agent-config.yaml"))
  })
  volume {
    name = "infisical-efs"
    efs_volume_configuration {
      file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.infisical_efs.id
      root_directory = "/"
    }
  }
}
...snip...
```

After these values have been set, they will be passed to the Infisical agent during startup through environment variables, as configured in the `infisical-sidecar` container below.

```terraform templates/ecs/cb_app.json.tpl
[
...snip...
  {
    "name": "infisical-sidecar",
    "image": "${sidecar_image}",
    "cpu": 1024,
    "memory": 1024,
    "networkMode": "bridge",
    "command": ["agent"],
    "essential": false,
    "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "/ecs/agent",
          "awslogs-region": "${aws_region}",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "ecs"
        }
    },
    "healthCheck": {
        "command": ["CMD-SHELL", "agent", "--help"],
        "interval": 30,
        "timeout": 5,
        "retries": 3,
        "startPeriod": 0
    },
    "environment": [
      {
        "name": "INFISICAL_MACHINE_IDENTITY_ID",
        "value": "${machine_identity_id}"
      },
      {
        "name": "INFISICAL_AGENT_CONFIG_BASE64",
        "value": "${agent_config}"
      }
    ],
    "mountPoints": [
      {
          "containerPath": "/infisical-agent",
          "sourceVolume": "infisical-efs"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In the above container definition, you'll notice that that the Infisical agent has a `mountPoints` defined.
This mount point is referencing to the already configured EFS volume as shown below.
`containerPath` is set to `/infisical-agent` because that is that the folder we have instructed the agent to deposit the credentials to.

```hcl terraform/efs.tf
resource "aws_efs_file_system" "infisical_efs" {
  tags = {
    Name = "INFISICAL-ECS-EFS"
  }
}

resource "aws_efs_mount_target" "mount" {
  count           = length(aws_subnet.private.*.id)
  file_system_id  = aws_efs_file_system.infisical_efs.id
  subnet_id       = aws_subnet.private[count.index].id
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.efs_sg.id]
}
```

## Configure AWS credentials

Because we'll be deploying the example file browser application to AWS via Terraform, you will need to obtain a set of `AWS Access Key` and `Secret Key`.
Once you have generated these credentials, export them to your terminal.

1. Export the AWS Access Key ID:

   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your AWS access key ID>
   ```

2. Export the AWS Secret Access Key:

   ```bash
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your AWS secret access key>
   ```

## Deploy terraform configuration

With the agent's sidecar configuration complete, we can now deploy our changes to AWS via Terraform.

1. Change your directory to `terraform`

```sh
cd terraform
```

2. Initialize Terraform

```
$ terraform init
```

3. Preview resources that will be created

```
$ terraform plan
```

4. Trigger resource creation

```bash
$ terraform apply

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
```

```bash

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 1 changed, 1 destroyed.

Outputs:

alb_hostname = "cb-load-balancer-1675475779.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:8080"
```

Once the resources have been successfully deployed, Terraform will output the host address where the file browser application will be accessible.
It may take a few minutes for the application to become fully ready.

## Verify secrets/tokens in EFS volume

To verify that the agent is depositing access tokens and rendering secrets to the paths specified in the agent config, navigate to the web address from the previous step.
Once you visit the address, you'll be prompted to login. Enter the credentials shown below.

![file browser main login page](/images/guides/agent-with-ecs/file_browser_main.png)

Since our EFS volume is mounted to the path of the file browser application, we should see the access token and rendered secret file we defined via the agent config file.

![file browswer dashbaord](/images/guides/agent-with-ecs/filebrowser_afterlogin.png)

As expected, two files are present: `access-token` and `secrets`.
The `access-token` file should hold a valid `Bearer` token, which can be used to make HTTP requests to Infisical.
The `secrets` file should contain secrets, formatted according to the specifications in our secret template file (presented in key=value format).
