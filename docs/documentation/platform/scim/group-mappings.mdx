## SCIM Group to Organization Role Mapping

By default, when users are provisioned via SCIM, they will be assigned the default organization role configured in [Organization General Settings](/documentation/platform/organization#settings).

For more precise control over membership roles, you can set up SCIM Group to Organization Role Mappings. This enables you to assign specific roles based on the group from which a user is provisioned.

To configure a mapping, simply enter the SCIM group's name and select the role you would like users to be assigned from this group. Be sure
to tap **Update Mappings** once complete.

<Note>
    SCIM Group Mappings only apply when users are first provisioned. Previously provisioned users will not be affected, allowing you to customize user roles after they are added.
