Certain environments and secrets are so sensitive that it is recommended to not give any user permanent access to those. For such use cases, Infisical supports the functionality of **Temporary Access** provisioning. 


To provision temporary access through Web UI: 
1. Click on the `Edit` button next to the set of roles for user or identities.

2. Click `Permanent` next to the role or specific privilege that you want to make temporary. 

3. Specify the duration of remporary access (e.g., `1m`, `2h`, `3d`).

4. Click `Grant`.

5. Click the corresponding `Save` button to enable remporary access.

<Note>
Every user and machine identity should always have at least one permanent role attached to it.
