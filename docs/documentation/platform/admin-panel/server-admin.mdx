The Server Admin Console provides **server administrators** with the ability to
customize settings and manage users for their entire Infisical instance.

<Note>
    The first user to setup an account on your Infisical instance is designated as the server administrator by default.

### Allow User Signups

User signups are enabled by default, allowing **Anyone** with access to your instance to sign up. This can alternatively be **Disabled** to prevent any users from signing up.

### Restrict Signup Domain

Signup can be restricted to users matching one or more email domains, such as your organization's domain, to control who has access to your instance.

### Default Organization

If you're using SAML/LDAP/OIDC for only one organization on your instance, you can specify a default organization to use at login to skip requiring users to manually enter the organization slug.

### Trust Emails

By default, users signing up through SAML/LDAP/OIDC will still need to verify their email address to prevent email spoofing. This requirement can be skipped by enabling the switch to trust logins through the respective method.


## Authentication Tab

From this tab, you can configure which login methods are enabled for your instance.

## Rate Limit Tab

This tab allows you to set various rate limits for your Infisical instance. You do not need to redeploy when making changes to rate limits as these will be propagated automatically.
