Infisical provides audit logs for security and compliance teams to monitor information access.
With the Audit Log functionality, teams can:
- **Track** 40+ different events;
- **Filter** audit logs by event, actor, source, date or any combination of these filters;
- **Inspect** extensive metadata in the event of any suspicious activity or incident review.

Each log contains the following data:

- **Event**: The underlying action such as create, list, read, update, or delete secret(s).
- **Actor**: The entity responsible for performing or causing the event; this can be a user or service.
- **Timestamp**: The date and time at which point the event occurred.
- **Source** (User agent + IP): The software (user agent) and network address (IP) from which the event was initiated.
- **Metadata**: Additional data to provide context for each event. For example, this could be the path at which a secret was fetched from etc.
