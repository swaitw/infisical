Infisical's AWS IAM User secret rotation capability lets you update the **Access key** and **Secret access key** credentials of a target IAM user from within Infisical
at a specified interval or on-demand.

## Workflow

The typical workflow for using the AWS IAM User rotation strategy consists of four steps:

1. Creating the target IAM user whose credentials you wish to rotate.
2. Creating the managing IAM user used by Infisical to rotate the credentials of the target IAM user.
3. Configuring the rotation strategy in Infisical with the credentials of the managing IAM user.
4. Pressing the **Rotate** button in the Infisical dashboard to trigger the rotation of the target IAM user's credentials. The strategy can also be configured to rotate the credentials automatically at a specified interval.

In the following steps, we explore the end-to-end workflow for setting up this strategy in Infisical.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Create the target IAM user">
		To begin, create an IAM user whose credentials you wish to rotate. If you already have an IAM user,
		then you can skip this step.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Create the managing IAM user">
		Next, create another IAM user to be used by Infisical to rotate the credentials of the IAM user in the previous step.

		2.1. In your AWS console, head to IAM > Access management > Users and press **Create user**.
		
		![iam user secret rotation create user](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-manager-create-user.png)
		
		2.2. Next, give the user a username like **infisical-rotation-manager** and press **Next**.

		![iam user secret rotation username](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-manager-username.png)
		
		2.3. Next, in the **Set permissions** step, select **Attach policies directly** and then press **Create policy**.
		
		![iam user secret rotation create policy](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-manager-create-policy.png)
		
		2.4. Next, in the **Policy editor**, paste the following JSON and press **Next**:

		```json
		{
			"Version": "2012-10-17",
			"Statement": [
				{
					"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": [
					"iam:DeleteAccessKey",
					"iam:GetAccessKeyLastUsed",
					"iam:CreateAccessKey"
					],
					"Resource": "*"
				}
			]
		}
		```

		<Note>
			The IAM policy above uses the wildcard option in Resource: "*".
			
			You may want to restrict the policy to a specific path, and make any adjustments as necessary, to control access for the managing user in production.

		</Note>
		
		In the **Review and create** step, give the policy a name like **infisical-rotation-manager**, press **Create policy** to finish creating the policy.
		
		![iam user secret rotation policy review](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-manager-policy-review.png)

		2.5. Back in the **Set permissions** step from step 2.3, refresh the policy list and search for the policy you just created from step 2.4.
		
		Select the policy and press **Next**.
		
		![iam user secret rotation attach policy](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-manager-attach-policy.png)
		
		In the **Review and create** step, press **Create user** to finish creating the IAM user.
		
		![iam user secret rotation manager user review](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-manager-user-review.png)
		
		2.5. Having created the user, head to its Security credentials > Access keys and press **Create access key**.

		Follow the subsequent steps to create the **access key** and **secret access key** credential pair for the user.

		![iam user secret rotation manager create access key](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-manager-create-access-key.png)
		
		At the end of the flow, copy the **Access key** and **Secret access key** to use when configuring the AWS IAM User rotation strategy back in Infisical next.

	</Step>
	<Step title="Configure the AWS IAM User secret rotation strategy in Infisical">
		3.1. Back in Infisical, head to the Project > Secrets > Environment and path where you want the rotated AWS IAM credentials to appear and create two placeholder secrets.
		
		In this example, we'll create two secrets called `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
		
		![iam user secret rotation secrets](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-config-secrets.png)
		
		3.2. Next, in the **Secret Rotation** tab, press on the **AWS IAM** tile to configure the AWS IAM User rotation strategy.
		
		![iam user secret rotation select aws iam user method](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotations-select-aws-iam-user.png)
		
		3.3. Input the configuration details for the AWS IAM User rotation strategy obtained from steps 1 and 2:
		
		![iam user secret rotation config 1](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-config-1.png)
		
		Here's some guidance on each field:
		
		- Manager User Access Key: The managing IAM user's access key from step 2.5.
		- Manager User Secret Key: The managing IAM user's secret access key from step 2.5.
		- Manager User AWS Region: The [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) for Infisical to make requests to such as `us-east-1`.
		- IAM Username: The IAM username of the user from step 1.
		
		Next, specify the output secret mappings configuration for the rotated AWS IAM credentials; this is the secrets whose values will be replaced with new credentials after each rotation.
		Here, you can also specify a rotation interval for the credentials to be automatically rotated periodically.

		In this example, we want to map the output of the rotated AWS IAM credentials to the secrets that we created in step 3.1 (i.e. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
		
		![iam user secret rotation config 2](../../../images/platform/secret-rotation/aws-iam/rotation-config-2.png)
		
		Finally, press **Submit** to create the secret rotation strategy.
	</Step>
	<Step title="Rotate secrets in Infisical">
		You should now see the AWS IAM User rotation strategy listed in the **Secret Rotation** tab.
		
		To manually trigger a rotation, you can press the **Rotate** button on the strategy.
		Once triggered, the secrets in step 3.1 should be updated with new rotated credential values.

**FAQ**

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why are my AWS IAM credentials not rotating?">
  There are a few reasons for why this might happen:
  
  - The strategy configuration is invalid (e.g. the managing IAM user's credentials are incorrect, the target IAM username is incorrect, etc.).
  - The managing IAM user is insufficently permissioned to rotate the credentials of the target IAM user. For instance, you may have setup [paths](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/optimize-aws-administration-with-iam-paths/) for the managing IAM user and the policy does not have the necessary permissions to rotate the credentials.
  - The target IAM user already has 2 access keys configured in AWS; you should delete one of the access keys to allow for rotation.
