The Infisical SQL Server secret rotation allows you to automatically rotate your database users' passwords at a predefined interval.

## Prerequisites

1. Create two SQL Server logins and database users with the required permissions. We'll refer to them as `user-a` and `user-b`.
2. Create another SQL Server login with permissions to alter logins for `user-a` and `user-b`. We'll refer to this as the `admin` login.

Here's how to set up the prerequisites:

```sql
-- Create the logins (at server level)
CREATE LOGIN [user-a] WITH PASSWORD = 'ComplexPassword1';
CREATE LOGIN [user-b] WITH PASSWORD = 'ComplexPassword2';

-- Create database users for the logins (in your specific database)
USE [YourDatabase];
CREATE USER [user-a] FOR LOGIN [user-a];
CREATE USER [user-b] FOR LOGIN [user-b];

-- Grant necessary permissions to the users
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON SCHEMA::dbo TO [user-a];
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON SCHEMA::dbo TO [user-b];

-- Create admin login with permission to alter other logins
CREATE LOGIN [admin] WITH PASSWORD = 'AdminComplexPassword';
CREATE USER [admin] FOR LOGIN [admin];

-- Grant permission to alter any login
GRANT ALTER ANY LOGIN TO [admin];
```

## How it works

1. Infisical connects to your database using the provided `admin` login credentials.
2. A random value is generated and the password for `user-a` is updated with the new value.
3. The new password is then tested by logging into the database.
4. If test is successful, it's saved to the output secret mappings so that rest of the system gets the newly rotated value(s).
5. The process is then repeated for `user-b` on the next rotation.
6. The cycle repeats until secret rotation is deleted/stopped.

## Rotation Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Secret Rotation Page">
	Head over to Secret Rotation configuration page of your project by clicking on `Secret Rotation` in the left side bar 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on Microsoft SQL Server card" />
  <Step title="Provide the inputs">
	<ParamField path="Admin Username" type="string" required>
		SQL Server admin username
	</ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Admin password" type="string" required>
    	SQL Server admin password
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Host" type="string" required>
    	SQL Server host url (e.g., your-server.database.windows.net)
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Port" type="number" required>
    	Database port number (default: 1433)
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Database" type="string" required>
    	Database name (default: master)
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Username1" type="string" required>
    	The first login name to rotate - `user-a`
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Username2" type="string" required>
    	The second login name to rotate - `user-b`
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="CA" type="string">
    	Optional database certificate to connect with database
    </ParamField>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the output secret mapping">
  	When a secret rotation is successful, the updated values needs to be saved to an existing key(s) in your project.

    <ParamField path="Environment" type="string" required>
    	The environment where the rotated credentials should be mapped to.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Secret Path" type="string" required>
    	The secret path where the rotated credentials should be mapped to.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="Interval" type="number" required>
    	What interval should the credentials be rotated in days.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="DB USERNAME" type="string" required>
    	Select an existing secret key where the rotated database username value should be saved to.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField path="DB PASSWORD" type="string" required>
    	Select an existing select key where the rotated database password value should be saved to.
    </ParamField>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
 <Accordion title="Why can't we delete the other user when rotating?">
 	When a system has multiple nodes by horizontal scaling, redeployment doesn't happen instantly.

    This means that when the secrets are rotated, and the redeployment is triggered, the existing system will still be using the old credentials until the change rolls out.

    To avoid causing failure for them, the old credentials are not removed. Instead, in the next rotation, the previous user's credentials are updated.

 </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="Why do you need an admin account?">
    The admin account is used by Infisical to update the credentials for `user-a` and `user-b`.

    You don't need to grant all permissions for your admin account but rather just the permission to alter logins (ALTER ANY LOGIN).

 </Accordion>
 <Accordion title="How does this work with Azure SQL Database?">
   When using Azure SQL Database, you'll need to:
   
   1. Use the full server name as your host (e.g., your-server.database.windows.net)
   2. Ensure your admin account is either the Azure SQL Server admin or an Azure AD account with appropriate permissions
   3. Configure your Azure SQL Server firewall rules to allow connections from Infisical's IP addresses
