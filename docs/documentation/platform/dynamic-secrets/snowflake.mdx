Infisical's Snowflake dynamic secrets allow you to generate Snowflake user credentials on demand.

## Snowflake Prerequisites

<Note>
    Infisical requires a Snowflake user in your account with the USERADMIN role. This user will act as a service account for Infisical and facilitate the creation of new users as needed.
</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Navigate to Snowflake's User Dashboard and press the '+ User' button">

                Be sure to uncheck "Force user to change password on first time login"

## Set up Dynamic Secrets with Snowflake

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open the Secret Overview Dashboard">
        Open the Secret Overview dashboard and select the environment in which you would like to add a dynamic secret.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click on the 'Add Dynamic Secret' button">
        ![Add Dynamic Secret Button](/images/platform/dynamic-secrets/add-dynamic-secret-button.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select the Snowflake option in the grid list">
        ![Dynamic Secret Modal](/images/platform/dynamic-secrets/snowflake/dynamic-secret-snowflake-modal.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Provide the required parameters for the Snowflake dynamic secret">
        <ParamField path="Secret Name" type="string" required>
            The name you want to reference this secret by
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField path="Default TTL" type="string" required>
            Default time-to-live for a generated secret (it is possible to modify this value when generating a secret)
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField path="Max TTL" type="string" required>
            Maximum time-to-live for a generated secret
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField path="Account Identifier" type="string" required>
            Snowflake account identifier
        </ParamField>

        <ParamField path="Organization Identifier" type="string" required>
            Snowflake organization identifier
        </ParamField>

            Password of the Infisical Service User
        </ParamField>

    </Step>
    <Step title="(Optional) Modify SQL Statements">
        If you want to provide specific privileges for the generated dynamic credentials, you can modify the SQL
        statement to your needs.
        ![Modify SQL Statements Modal](/images/platform/dynamic-secrets/snowflake/dynamic-secret-snowflake-sql-statements.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click 'Submit'">
        After submitting the form, you will see a dynamic secret created in the dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Generate dynamic secrets">
        Once you've successfully configured the dynamic secret, you're ready to generate on-demand credentials.
        To do this, simply click on the 'Generate' button which appears when hovering over the dynamic secret item.
        Alternatively, you can initiate the creation of a new lease by selecting 'New Lease' from the dynamic secret
        lease list section.

        ![Dynamic Secret](/images/platform/dynamic-secrets/dynamic-secret-lease-empty.png)

        When generating these secrets, it's important to specify a Time-to-Live (TTL) duration. This will dictate how
        long the credentials are valid for.

        <Tip>
            Ensure that the TTL for the lease fall within the maximum TTL defined when configuring the dynamic secret in
            step 4.
        </Tip>


        Once you click the `Submit` button, a new secret lease will be generated and the credentials for it will be
        shown to you.

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Audit or Revoke Leases

Once you have created one or more leases, you will be able to access them by clicking on the respective dynamic secret item on the dashboard.
This will allow you to see the lease details and delete the lease ahead of its expiration time.

## Renew Leases

To extend the life of the generated dynamic secret lease past its initial time to live, simply click on the **Renew** button as illustrated below.

<Warning>
    Lease renewals cannot exceed the maximum TTL set when configuring the dynamic
    secret.
