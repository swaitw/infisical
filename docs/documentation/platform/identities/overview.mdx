To interact with secrets and resource with Infisical, it is important to understand the concept of identities. 
Identities can be of two types: 
- **People** (e.g., developers, platform engineers, administrators)
- **Machines** (e.g., machine entities for managing secrets in CI/CD pipelines, production applications, and more)

Both people and machines are able to utilize corresponding clients (e.g., Dashboard UI, CLI, SDKs, API, Kubernetes Operator) together with allowed authentication methods (e.g., email & password, SAML SSO, LDAP, OIDC, Universal Auth).
