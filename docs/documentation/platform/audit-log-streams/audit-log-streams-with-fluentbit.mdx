<Info>
    Audit log streams is a paid feature.
   
    If you're using Infisical Cloud, then it is available under the **Enterprise Tier**. If you're self-hosting Infisical,
    then you should contact team@infisical.com to purchase an enterprise license to use it.

This guide will demonstrate how you can send Infisical Audit log streams to storage solutions that do not support direct HTTP-based ingestion, such as AWS S3.
To achieve this, you will learn how you can use a log collector like Fluent Bit to capture and forward logs from Infisical to non-HTTP storage options. 
In this pattern, Fluent Bit acts as an intermediary, accepting HTTP log streams from Infisical and transforming them into a format that can be sent to your desired storage provider.

## Overview

Log collectors are tools used to collect, analyze, transform, and send logs to storage. 
For the purposes of this guide, we will use [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io) as our log collector and send logs from Infisical to AWS S3. 
However, this is just a example and you can use any log collector of your choice. 

## Deploy Fluent Bit

You can deploy Fluent Bit in one of two ways:
1. As a sidecar to your self-hosted Infisical instance
2. As a standalone service in any deployment/compute service (e.g., AWS EC2, ECS, or GCP Compute Engine)

To view all deployment methods, visit the [Fluent Bit Getting Started guide](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/getting-started-with-fluent-bit).

## Configure Fluent Bit

To set up Fluent Bit, you'll need to provide a configuration file that establishes an HTTP listener and configures an output to send JSON data to your chosen storage solution.

The following Fluent Bit configuration sets up an HTTP listener on port `8888` and sends logs to AWS S3:

```ini
[SERVICE]
    Flush        1
    Log_Level    info
    Daemon       off

[INPUT]
    Name   http
    Listen 0.0.0.0
    Port   8888

[OUTPUT]
    Name                         s3
    Match                        *
    bucket                       my-bucket
    region                       us-west-2
    total_file_size              50M
    use_put_object               Off
    compression                  gzip
    s3_key_format                /$TAG/%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S.gz
```
### Connecting Infisical Audit Log Stream

Once Fluent Bit is set up and configured, you can point the Infisical [audit log stream](/documentation/platform/audit-log-streams/audit-log-streams) to Fluent Bit's HTTP listener, which will then forward the logs to your chosen provider. 
Using this pattern, you are able to send Infisical Audit logs to various providers that do not support HTTP based log ingestion by default.
